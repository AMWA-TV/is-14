## Introduction

This document aims to give a general description of the NMOS Device Configuration API. This API defines how NMOS Control models (described in the NMOS Control Framework) can be exposed and consumed in a standardized way when using HTTP.

This document relies on previous familiarity with the following existing documents:

* [AMWA MS-05-01 NMOS Control Architecture](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-01)
* [AMWA MS-05-02 NMOS Control Framework](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-02)

This API does not support subscriptions and notifications. For subscriptions and notifications support see [AMWA IS-12](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-12/).

## Use of Normative Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC-2119].

## Definitions

The NMOS term 'Device' is used as defined in the [NMOS Glossary](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/main/docs/Glossary.html).
